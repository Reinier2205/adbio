# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables event administrators to dynamically configure the 25 bingo squares for EventBingo games instead of using hardcoded values. The system will provide an admin interface for square management while maintaining game integrity once events begin.

## Glossary

- **EventBingo System**: The web application that manages bingo games with photo uploads
- **Admin Interface**: The user interface component that allows event configuration
- **Bingo Squares**: The 25 text descriptions that define what players need to photograph
- **Event Lock**: The state when square configuration becomes immutable after game activity begins
- **Square Validation**: The process of ensuring exactly 25 valid, non-empty squares are provided
