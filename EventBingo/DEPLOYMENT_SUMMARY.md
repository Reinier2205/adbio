# EventBingo Deployment Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Done
- R2 and KV bindings are configured in Cloudflare
- Worker code updated to use both storage types correctly
- Event code extraction from form data fixed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Fix

### 1. Deploy Updated Worker Code

You need to deploy the updated `worker.js` that has the fixes for:
- Proper photo storage in R2
- URL references stored in KV
- Better error handling and logging

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Workers & Pages ‚Üí `shy-recipe-5fb1`
3. Click `</> Edit code`
4. Copy entire content from `worker.js` in your repo
5. Paste and click `Save and deploy`

### 2. Test Photo Display Issue

After deployment, upload a new photo to test:
1. Go to event: `?event=ddddffff`
2. Upload a photo
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Look for log messages like:
   - "KV get result type:"
   - "KV get result value:"
   - "Found photo URL for..."

If photos still don't display:
- Check the URL returned by the worker
- Verify it's a valid URL format
- Check if the photo exists in R2 bucket

### 3. Debug Steps

**For Photos Not Showing:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Upload a photo
4. Look for any error messages
5. Check Network tab to see if image requests are failing

**For Player Circle Not Appearing:**
- This might be a caching issue
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Or it's timing - the circle appears after `loadPlayers()` finishes

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Deploy updated worker.js** (most important!)
2. **Test photo upload**
3. **Check console logs** for any errors
4. **Report back** what you see in the console

The updated worker code includes better logging to help diagnose the issue.
